# Hey, welcome to my GitHub. I'm @Kedislav.

Piece of code I write and test, I'll probably publish. I started programming recently, so don't be shy if you see any need for corrections. I'm a 21 y/o student who's obsessed with learning, yet out of all the things I've taken up, few survive the test of time. Coding, among others, have sticked around, so I've decided to stay learning it for a while. It is a really versatile skill to have— coding, I mean. I'm glad to have picked it up and I'm curious to see where I end up.

Languages I know by now; Bash, Python, Swift.
