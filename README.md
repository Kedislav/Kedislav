# Hey, welcome to my GitHub. I'm @Kedislav.

Piece of code I write and test, I'll probably publish. I started programming recently, so don't be shy if you see any need for corrections. I'm a 21 y/o student who's obsessed with learning, yet out of all the things I've taken up, few survive the test of time. Coding, among others, have sticked around, so I've decided to stay learning it for a while. It is a really versatile skill to have— coding, I mean. I'm glad to have picked it up and I'm curious to see where I end up.

As I believe you have assumed by now, I love learning. I love finding out new interests and throwing myself at them. It is one of the things that bring me joy when I do them. I'm an avid water drinker, also tea. I still can't leave sugar. My favorite cake is cheesecake. Another curious fact about me? I've never been able to sleep face down, I just can't. Anyway, besides this monologue here, hope you enjoy. I'm fairly new to everything so don't hesitate to offer advice if you have it.

Languages I know by now; Python, Go, Swift.
